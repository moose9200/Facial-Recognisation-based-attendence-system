# Facial-Recognisation-based-attendence-system
I would like to bring in a smart attendance system, 
which will help in recognising the students face and update the document with their Student Id and Student Name. 
Another main point of concern for us to introduce smart attendance system is time-consuming. Assuming for each class, 
I take roughly 5 to 10 mins to take the students’ attendance, and for every teacher, it is an additional task that consumes their time. 
With the world moving to automation more and more every day, I used image processing to develop the automatic process.  
I used Face detection to identify a person’s face and face recognition to verify the identified person’s face with the one I have in our database.
